suggestions for improvement:
- Implement the `__str__` method to fulfill step 5.
- Add the try/except block for handling ValueError in `go_to_page` as described in the test cases.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements the `Pagination` class, including the `__init__`, `get_visible_items`, `go_to_page`, `first_page`, `last_page`, `next_page`, and `previous_page` methods, as described in the prompt. The method chaining requirement is also fulfilled. The code is missing the `__str__` method and the error handling for out of range pages is not in a `try/except` block as the test cases suggest.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear variable names and comments where necessary.  The use of `self` is consistent, and the logic is straightforward.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given task, using slicing for `get_visible_items` and simple arithmetic for navigation.  No performance bottlenecks are apparent.
- security: There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in the code.  The input `page_num` is validated in `go_to_page` to prevent out-of-bounds access.
